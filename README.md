# 👋 Hi, I'm Usman Umar Garba

**Mobile Software Engineer (Flutter) • Backend Developer • Bitcoin & Lightning • Rust**

## 🚀 About Me

I build **production-grade mobile applications** and **scalable backend systems** with a strong focus on **payments and financial infrastructure**.

My work sits at the intersection of:

- **Mobile Engineering** — Flutter apps with clean UX, animations, and strict flows  
- **Backend Development** — APIs, authentication, databases, and system design  
- **Bitcoin & Lightning** — wallets, transaction flows, security-first design  
- **Rust Systems** — performance-focused tools and backend components  

I care deeply about **shipping real products**, not just demos.

## 🧠 What I Build

- Flutter mobile apps with clear user journeys and polished UI/UX  
- Backend APIs using modern frameworks and scalable architectures  
- Bitcoin & Lightning-enabled applications with strong security guarantees  
- Rust-based services and tools where performance and safety matter  
- End-to-end systems: mobile → backend → payments → infrastructure
